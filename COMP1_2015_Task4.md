#Task Sheet 4 - Other Improvements

##Introduction
This final sheet highlights other possible improvements that could be made to the Capture the Sarrum game.

##Task 29 - Board Size
It is possible that the board could be made larger to accommodate more pieces. Make the changes necessary so that the board is of size **9 x 9** and a **Kashshaptu** piece is included for each side as well as an additional **Redum**.

##Task 30 - Alternative Saving
In the previous set of tasks you create functions to save high scores and board state to files. You will have chosen to use either a **binary** file or **text** file.

**Refactor** these functions to use the other method and ensure that the program still functions as before.

##Task 31 - Logging
It is possible that as well as tracking the number of moves each player makes, the game also tracks all of the pieces that were moved during the course of a game.

This would mean that it would be possible to **replay** a previous game to highlight tactics or similar.

Add the ability to log each move that was made and then attempt to add the ability to replay a log that had been previously saved to a file.
